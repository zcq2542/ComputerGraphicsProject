## Title: Deep In Woods
* This is a game of a person in the woods with a flashlight in hand that only lasts for 30 seconds. 
* The main objective is to find the target "Chalice". 
* Your flashlight will run out of battery over time. Collect batteries on the group to extend its duration. Every battery will extend light the duration for another 30 seconds. 
* It is game over if you cannot collect a battery within 10 seconds after your flashlight run out of battery.
* Note that it is a large map (40X40), and the game is quite challenging. Enjoy~!

## Techniques used 
* Phong Lighting
* Texture
* Billboarding
* Instancing
* Collision calculation
